# Segmentation-Driven-Quantization-for-Image-Encoding
The human visual system focuses on active areas in images, such as people or vehicles. This project introduces a lossy encoder using image segmentation to guide quantization, improving compression while preserving quality. Less critical areas undergo higher quantization at the block level. The diagram below illustrates the process.
